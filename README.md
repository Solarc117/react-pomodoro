# react-pomodoro
A version of my (pomodoro repository)[https://github.com/Solarc117/pomodoro], only with React and without Redux. Built for Heroku deployment.

Allows the user to set the length of: 
- Focus session
- Short breaks (between focus sessions, in the same cycle)
- Long breaks (between cycles)

As well as:
- The number of focus sessions per pomodoro cycle
- The number of cycles they wish to complete

Provides an audio notification upon a session or break end.
